### Predicting Student Success
**Two different notebooks:**
1. ML_PROJECT_DATA.ipnb
    - This includes code for part 1 of the project
    - Only uses college data
    - Determines what deems a "better" college and tries to explain why
    - Used this to find and examine outliers as well

2. student_success.ipynb
    - This includes code for part 2 of the project
    - Uses college data and individual student data
    - Tries to find a model to estimate student salary

####Notes
[College Scorecard Data](http://https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/ "College Scorecard Data")    - The csv files used in ML_PROJECT_DATA have been created to only have the columns used in the notebook. This is becasue the dataset was too large for github. The large files used can be found 
- The data used for everything except latitude and longitude was in  "Data/MERGED2013_14_PP.csv"
- The data that was used for latitude and longitude was extracted from "Data/MERGED2018_19_PP.csv"
